Tcpdump
========
Tcpdump is a commandline tool that is used to dump traffic on a network. This
tool comes in hand when you want to analyse network captures within the
command line. Basically it can do most of the wireshark job.

**NOTE** This guide might not be complete it just serve as a reference to me.

Additional Note & Reference
==============================

To be fair: This gist is itself a fork I created some time ago, but the original gist 
or author seems to not exist anymore, and it looks like that I'm now in the lead ;-)
Please see the revision history for details.

Options
=======
The following are some of options that I prefer when using `tcpdump` for my
daily use.

tcpdump [OPTIONS]
```shell
-i any : Listen to all the interfaces
-i virbr0: Listen to a specific interface virbr0
-D: Show the list of available interface
-n: Don't resolve the hostnames
-nn: Don't resolve hostnames or port names.
-q: quite output
-t: Don't print a timestamp on each dump line.
-tttt: Give maximally human-readbale timestamp output
-X: Show the packet's contents in both HEX ad ASCII
-XX: Same as -X but shows the ethernet header.
-v, -vv, -vvv: Being more verbose(increase number of packet information)
-c: Only capture number of packets and stop
-s: Define the snaplength(size) of the capture in bytes. Use -s0 to get
everything.
-S: Print absolute sequence numbers.
-e: Get the ethernet header as well
-E: Decrypt IPSEC traffic by providing an encryption key.
```
### Expressions
`tcpdump` allow us to use expression so we can narrow down our solution to get
exactly what we're looking for.

There are 3 types of expression: `type`, `dir` and `proto`

+ Type options are: `host`,`net`, and `port`
+ Direction are: `src` and `dst`
+ Protocol : `tcp`,`udp`,`icmp`,`ah` etc

### Examples
1. Basic communication to see what happens on the network

        $ tcpdump -i any
        
2. Monitor specific interface

        $ tcpdump -i virbr0

3. Raw output view with verbose output,no host/port resolution,absolute sequence number and
   human-readable timestamps.

        $ tcpdump -ttttnnvvS

4. Find traffic by IP
        
        $ tcpdump host 192.168.122.131

5. Seeing packets with HEX output
        
        $ tcpdump -nnvXSs 0 -c1 icmp

6. Filtering by Source and Destination

        $ tcpdump src 192.168.122.131
        $ tcpdump dst 192.168.122.14

7. Finding packets by network
        
        $ tcpdump net 192.168.122.0/24

8. Show traffic related to a specific port

        $ tcpdump port 3389

9. Show traffic of one protocol

        $ tcpdump icmp

10. Show only IPv6 Traffic

        $ tcpdump ip6

11. Find traffic using Port ranges

        $ tcpdump portrange 21-25

12. Find traffic base on packet size
        
        $ tcpdump less 32

        $ tcpdump greater 32

        $ tcpdump <= 102

13. Writing captures to a file

        $ tcpdump port 80 -w output

14. Reading from pcap files

        $ tcpdump -r output.pcap

### More Examples
1. Options Combination
   + AND : `and` or `&&`
   + OR : `or` or `||`
   + EXCEPT : `not` or `!`

    ```
    $ tcpdump -nnvvS src 192.168.122.1 and dst port 4444
    ```

2. Complex grouping and special characters
   For complex grouping we use `()` to specify our options

    ```
    $ tcpdump 'src 192.168.122.84 and (dst port 4444 or 22)'
    ```

3. Isolating Specific TCP Flags. The filter `tcp[13]` look at offset 13 in `TCP HEADER`,hence the number
   represent the location within the byte, while the `!=0` means that the flag
   is set to 1.\
   Show all URGENT (URG) packets\

        $ tcpdump 'tcp[13] & 32!=0'
   Show all ACKNOWLEDGE( ACK) packets\
        
        $ tcpdump 'tcp[13] & 16!=0'
   Show all PUSH (PSH) packets\
        
        $ tcpdump 'tcp[13] & 8!=0'
   Show all RESET (RST packets\
        
        $ tcpdump 'tcp[13] & 4!=0'
   Show all SYNCHRONIZE (SYN) packets\
        
        $ tcpdump 'tcp[13] & 2!=0'
   Show all FINISH (FIN) packets\
        
        $ tcpdump 'tcp[13] & 1!=0'
   Show all SYNCRONIZE/ACKNOWLEDGE (SYNACK) packets\
        
        $ tcpdump 'tcp[13]=18'
   Alternative we could also use `tcpflags` syntax

        $ tcpdump 'tcp[tcpflags] == tcp-syn'
        $ tcpdump 'tcp[tcpflags] == tcp-rst'
        $ tcpdump 'tcp[tcpflags] == tcp-fin'

4. Identifying malformed/malicious packets.
   + Packets with both rst and syn flags shouldn't be the case.
        
            $ tcpdump 'tcp=[13] = 6'
   + Find cleartext http get requests

            $ tcpdump 'tcp[32:4] = 0x47455420'
   + Find ssh connection on any port via (banner text)
        
            $ # tcpdump 'tcp[(tcp[12]>>2):4] = 0x5353482D'
